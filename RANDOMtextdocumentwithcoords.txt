The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a timewhen humanity 

first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five-dollar bet over highballs,
 and it happened this way:Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of 
Multivac. Aswell as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashingface
 -- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notionof the general 
plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point whereany single human could possibly
 have a firm grasp of the whole.Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for 
nothing human couldadjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough. So Adell and 
Lupovattended the monstrous giant -8.604105°, -125.000000°, 2022-10-31T12:47:33+00:00, id3 only lightly and 
superficially, yet as well as any men could.
They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that wereissued. 
Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glorythat was 
Multivac's.For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that 
enabledman to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could notsupport
 the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coaland uranium 
with increasing efficiency, -7.254858°, -123.819349°, 2022-11-01T15:47:33+00:00, id1 but there was only so
much of both.But slowly Multivac learned enough to 
answer deeper questions more fundamentally, andon May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.
The energy of the sun was stored, -8°7.306336', -123°19.497748', 2022-10-31T10:47:33+00:00, id3 converted, 
and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale.All Earth 
turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch thatconnected all of it 
to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half thedistance of the Moon. All 
Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell 
and Lupov finally managedto escape from the public functions, -7°37'25.9927", -123°56'59.288", 2022-10-31T15:47:33+00:00, id2 
and to meet in quiet where no one would 
think oflooking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mightyburied body 
of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazyclickings, Multivac, too, had 
earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They hadno intention, originally, of disturbing it.
They had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relaxin the company of 
each other and the bottle."It's amazing when you think of it," said Adell. His broad face had lines of 
weariness init, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily
about. "All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. Enough energy, if we wanted todraw on it, to melt 
all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron, and still never miss theenergy so used. All the energy we 
could ever use, forever and forever and forever."Lupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that 
when he wanted to becontrary, and he wanted to be contrary now, partly because he had had to carry the iceand 
glassware. "Not forever," he said."Oh, hell, just about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert.""That's not 
forever.""All right, then. Billions and billions of years. Ten billion, maybe. Are you satisfied?"Lupov put 
his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that somewas still left and sipped gently
 at his own drink. "Ten billion years isn't forever.""Well, it will last our time, won't it?""So would the 
coal and uranium.""All right, but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station, and 
itcan go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. You can't dothaton coal and 
uranium. Ask Multivac, if you don't believe me."I don't have to ask Multivac. I know that.""Then stop
running down what Multivac's done for us," said Adell, blazing up, "It did allright.""Who says it didn't? 
What I say is that a sun won't last forever. That's all I'm saying.We're safe for ten billion years, but then 
what?" Lupow pointed a slightly shaky finger atthe other. "And don't say we'll switch to another sun."There 
was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally, andLupov's eyes slowly closed. 
They rested.Then Lupov's eyes snapped open. "You're thinking we'll switch to another sun when oursis done, 
aren't you?""I'm not thinking.""Sure you are. You're weak on logic, that's the trouble with you. You're like
 the guy inthe story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and gotunder one.
 He wasn't worried, you see, because he figured when one tree got wet through,he would just get under another 
one.""I get it," said Adell. "Don't shout. -7°26.405536', -124°43.21273', 2022-10-31T15:47:33+00:00, id1 When 
the sun is done, the other stars will be gone,too.""Darn right they will," muttered Lupov. "It all had a beginning
 in the original cosmicexplosion, whatever that was, and it'll all have an end when all the stars run down. 
Somerun down faster than others. Hell, the giants won't last a hundred million years. The sunwill last ten billion
 years and maybe the dwarfs will last two hundred billion for all thegood they are. But just give us a trillion 
years and everything will be dark. Entropy has toincrease to maximum, that's all.""I know all about entropy," 
said Adell, standing on his dignity."The hell you do.""I know as much as you do.""Then you know everything's got
 to run down someday.""All right. Who says they won't?""You did, you poor sap. You said we had all the energy we
 needed, forever. You said'forever.
